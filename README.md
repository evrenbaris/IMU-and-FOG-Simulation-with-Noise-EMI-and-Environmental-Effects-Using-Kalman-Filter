# IMU and FOG Simulation with Noise, EMI, and Environmental Effects

## Description
This project simulates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) under real-world conditions, including:
- Noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- Environmental effects like temperature and vibration.
- Filtering techniques (Kalman filter) to mitigate noise and EMI.

## Features
- Simulates accelerometer and gyroscope data with noise.
- Adds dynamic EMI and environmental effects to FOG data.
- Applies Kalman filtering to improve data accuracy.
- Visualizes the impact of EMI, environmental conditions, and filtering.

## Future Enhancements
- Add magnetometer simulation for complete IMU functionality.
- Implement dynamic military-standard test scenarios.
- Extend the system to real-time hardware testing.

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
